Certainly! Let's go through the code step by step with `nums = [2, 7, 11, 15]` and `target = 9` as an example.

```python
class Solution:
    def twoSum(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> List[int]:
        num_dict = {}  # A dictionary to store seen elements
        for idx, val in enumerate(nums):
            complement = target - val
            if complement in num_dict:
                return [num_dict[complement], idx]
            num_dict[val] = idx  # Add the current element to the dictionary
        return []  # If no valid pair is found, return an empty list
```

1. The function `twoSum` takes a list of integers `nums` and an integer `target` as input.

2. `num_dict` is an empty dictionary that will be used to store seen elements in the list. The keys will be the elements themselves, and the values will be their indices.

3. The code iterates through the list `nums` using a `for` loop along with the `enumerate` function. The `enumerate` function provides both the index (`idx`) and the value (`val`) of each element in `nums`.

4. For each element in `nums`, the code calculates the `complement`, which is `target - val`. In this example, with `target = 9` and the first element `val = 2`, the complement is `9 - 2 = 7`.

5. The code then checks if the `complement` is in the `num_dict` (the dictionary that stores seen elements). If it is, that means a pair of elements has been found whose sum is equal to the `target`. In this case, `complement` (7) is indeed in the dictionary.

6. If a valid pair is found, the code returns a list with the indices of the two elements that form the pair. In this example, the indices of the elements with values 2 and 7 are returned: `[0, 1]`. Note that the indices start from 0.

7. If no valid pair is found after iterating through the entire list, the code returns an empty list (`[]`), indicating that no such pair exists that adds up to the `target`.

So, for `nums = [2, 7, 11, 15]` and `target = 9`, the function returns `[0, 1]` because the elements at indices 0 and 1 (values 2 and 7) add up to the target value of 9.
