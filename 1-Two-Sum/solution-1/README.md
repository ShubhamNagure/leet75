The time complexity of the code you provided is O(n^2), where "n" is the number of elements in the `nums` list. This is because you have two nested `for` loops. The outer loop iterates through the list, and for each element in the outer loop, the inner loop iterates through the entire list again. This results in a quadratic time complexity, which can be highly inefficient for large input lists.
